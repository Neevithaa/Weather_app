# Weather_app

Project Description

The Weather Report Application is a responsive web application built using React JS that allows users to search and view real-time weather information for any city. The app fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using Axios and displays key weather details in a clean and user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates practical usage of React Hooks, API integration, component-based architecture, conditional rendering, error handling, and responsive design.
